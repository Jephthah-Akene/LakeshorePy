# LakeshorePy
LakeshorePy is a lightweight Python package for interfacing with and acquiring data from Lakeshore temperature monitors. It uses pyVISA to communicate with the instruments and provides a simple and cookie-cutter structure that can be extended for future models.

For questions or feature requests, please contact Jephthah Akene at 0xtachi@gmail.com. As an independent researcher, I built this project purely for the joy of creating something both enjoyable and practical. If you love to tinker and build innovative control systems, feel free to email me!
